# 🎯 Campus Bus Tracking System – Design Thinking Project

In this project, we explored issues faced by students using the campus bus system, including:

🚌 Long and uncertain waiting times
📍 Lack of real-time bus location information
🆘 Safety concerns, especially at night

We applied the Design Thinking process to develop our solution:

🧠 Empathize & Define – Understand user pain points through surveys and interviews
💡 Ideate – Brainstorm features and prioritize solutions
📐 Prototype – Create wireframes and low-fidelity designs
🔍 Test – Gather feedback to improve usability and usefulness

💻 Our proposed solution includes features such as real-time GPS tracking, ETA display, push notifications for delays, and night-time SOS support.

This project helped us understand the importance of human-centered design, teamwork, and translating user needs into practical solutions.
