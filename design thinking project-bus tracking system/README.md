# 🎯 Campus Bus Tracking System – Design Thinking Project

In this project, we explored issues faced by students using the campus bus system, including:

🚌 Long and uncertain waiting times
📍 Lack of real-time bus location information
🆘 Safety concerns, especially at night

We applied the Design Thinking process to develop our solution:

🧠 Empathize & Define – Understand user pain points through surveys and interviews
💡 Ideate – Brainstorm features and prioritize solutions
📐 Prototype – Create wireframes and low-fidelity designs
🔍 Test – Gather feedback to improve usability and usefulness

💻 Our proposed solution includes features such as real-time GPS tracking, ETA display, push notifications for delays, and night-time SOS support.

### Reflection
My goal is to become a member of an app development team where I can contribute to creating mobile applications that are helping people to solve problems in their life and can be widely used. I am working on Ideate and Prototype parts sin this project was crucial. I learned that a good app starts by combining everyone's ideas, and drawing the draft first is the better way before developing the apps.I plan to practice using the feature prioritization method in my future projects, to make better decisions that are focused on our users. I also plan to learn the basics of the development framework to understand and make a better fundamental for an app.

This project helped us understand the importance of human-centered design, teamwork, and translating user needs into practical solutions.
