### Reflection
We had the opportunity to interview one of the UTMDigital staff and learn about their daily work, as well as the important of UTMDigital in supporting the university’s operations through digital systems. This hands-on experience was very interesting and also fresh for us. The visit also featured talk sessions and technology booths, giving me a closer look at how technology is applied in real work environments. This experience increases my understanding of information systems in organizations and inspired me to explore technology beyond the classroom.

Hope you have fun and enjoy our little adventure! 😄
