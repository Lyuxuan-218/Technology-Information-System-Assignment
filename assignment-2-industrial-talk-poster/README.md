# 🎨 Industrial Talk Poster

This is our poster for the first industrial talk we attended!  

The talk gave us:
- 💡 Insights into the working world and career paths  
- 📝 Tips on what skills are needed in the industry  
- 👀 Inspiration for our own learning journey  

We then created this poster to highlight the **key points visually**.

### Reflection
This talk showed me that technology must align with business goals to create value. PPG’s multi-cloud approach proves there’s no “best” tech—only what fits best.
They also stressed that it’s not just about coding, but about solving real problems with data. This reminds me to keep learning technical skills like Python and SQL, while also thinking from a business perspective.

Hope you enjoy our summary of the talk! 😄
