# 🎨 Industrial Talk Poster

This is our poster for the first industrial talk we attended!  

The talk gave us:
- 💡 Insights into the working world and career paths  
- 📝 Tips on what skills are needed in the industry  
- 👀 Inspiration for our own learning journey  

We then created this poster to highlight the **key points visually**.
