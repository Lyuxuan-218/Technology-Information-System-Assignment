# Assignment 2: Industrial Talk Poster

This assignment is based on an industrial talk delivered by a guest speaker.

The talk gave us useful insights into the working world, including career paths and industry expectations.

We then designed a poster to highlight and summarize the key points from the talk in a clear and visual way.
