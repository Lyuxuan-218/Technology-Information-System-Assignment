# 💻 My TIS Adventures!

Welcome to my collection of **industrial visit & talk assignments**!  

Here you'll find:
- 🎥 **Assignment 1: Our UTMDigital Adventure** – a fun vlog of our industrial visit  
- 🎨 **Assignment 2: Industrial Talk Poster** – a poster summarizing key points from an industrial talk
- 📝 **Assignment 3: Academic Writing for Industrial Talk 2 **– a reflective essay on insights from the second industrial talk
- 🚢 **Assignment 4: Johor Port Industrial Visit **– a documentation and analysis of our second visit to Johor Port, focusing on port operations and logistics

These assignments helped me see how industry works and connect what we learn in class to the real world.  

Hope you enjoy exploring them! 😄
