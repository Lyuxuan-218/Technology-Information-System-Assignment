### Reflection

This industry visit allowed us to gain insight into the practical applications of technology and information systems in real-world industries. 
Seeing real dashboards and port operations helped us connect what we learned in class to actual industry practices.
We were also inspired to see that some staff at Johor Port Berhad are graduates from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, which boosted our confidence and motivation for our future careers in the technology field.
